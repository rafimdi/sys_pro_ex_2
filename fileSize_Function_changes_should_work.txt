add globabl variables:
long int file_size;//should already exist
int file_size_orginized[5];// we assume no file of size larger then 1024 terabytes exists in the system.

in the function ReturnFileSize:
void ReturnFileSize(FILE* file_to_test)
{
	int i=0;
	
	rewind(file_to_test);
	fseek(file_to_test,0,SEEK_END);
	file_size=ftell(file_to_test);
	while(file_size>0)// this was added (the purpose is obvious)
	{
		file_size_orginized[i]=(int)file_size%1024;
		file_size/=1024;//not sure if this is allowed
	}
	rewind(file_to_test);
}


in main: changes were made to print (so that it prints file size in bytes KBS etc as needed):
fprintf(log_file,"the file extension of the tested file is: %s\n",file_extension);
	fprintf(log_file,"the test file size is: ");
	for(i=0;i<=5;i++)
	{
		if(file_size_orginized[i]!=0)
		{
			switch (i)
			{
				case 0:
				fprintf(log_file,"%d, bytes ");
				break;
				case 1:
				fprintf(log_file,"%d, KBs ");
				break;
				case 2:
				fprintf(log_file,"%d, MBs ");
				break;
				case 3:
				fprintf(log_file,"%d, GBs ");
				break;
				case 4:
				fprintf(log_file,"%d, TBs ");
				break;
				case 5:
				fprintf(log_file,"%d, PBs ");
				break;
			}
		}
	}// next line has\n added to it for obvious reasons.

		fprintf(log_file,"\nthe file was created on %02d/%02d/%d  %02d:%02d\n",stLocal_create.wDay, stLocal_create.wMonth, stLocal_create.wYear,
